## My affair with Batch

Well, what can I say. Around 2012-2014 I got fond of Batch.
Maybe because it's available on every Windows machine, honestly I don't really know.
Somehow I liked things that work out of the box so I started writing small scripts
and later some more complicated ones.

Because of this interest, I soon created a guide to Batch for beginners, that you can
[read here](https://web.archive.org/web/20140718105020/https://logout.hu/cikk/batch_script_mint_teljeserteku_nyelv/teljes.html).
(The only problem is that it's written in hungarian)

## Motivation

Apparently I had just registered on GitHub and wanted to create my own
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) in... Batch.
The specification is pretty simple. It has to parse raw text files and create one big html file
filled with all the articles. Apparently I did not bother with creating different pages for different articles.

## The actual generator

Many years have passed since I touched Batch (note that these articles are more like necrologs)
so explaining how it works is going to be a little harder, especially because we're talking about Batch. The grammar is just exceptionally alien to me.

The root path of the repository contains 4 files and 1 directory like so:

- `articles`
- `_foot.html`
- `_head.html`
- `_sitebuild.bat`

Here we can see that the only command we can issue is `.\_sitebuild.bat`, the rest of the files are just content that the command reads and writes. Let's inspect this dreaded script.

```batch
@ECHO off
REM EVAL IN TWO ROW:
SETLOCAL EnableDelayedExpansion
REM SET UNICODE:
CHCP 65001

SET ARTICLES_DIR=articles
SET HEAD=_head.html
SET FOOT=_foot.html
SET GITHUB_USER=jbebe

TYPE %HEAD% > index.html
ECHO ^<div id="banner"^>%GITHUB_USER%/blog^</div^> >> index.html

FOR /F %%x IN ('DIR /B /D /O-D %ARTICLES_DIR%') DO (
  SET entry=%%x
  SET entry_date=!entry:~0,10!
  SET entry_title=!entry:~11!
  SET entry_title=!entry_title:_= !

  ECHO ^<div class="date"^>!entry_date!^</div^>^<div class="line"^>^</div^> >> index.html
  ECHO ^<h1^>^<a href="#%%x" id="%%x"^>!entry_title!^</a^>^</h1^> >> index.html
  ECHO. >> index.html
  TYPE %ARTICLES_DIR%\%%x >> index.html
  ECHO.^<br/^>>> index.html
)

TYPE %FOOT% >> index.html
```

## First 5 commands

On the first 5 lines we initialize the script.
The first line, or more specifically `ECHO off` tells Batch to turn off outputting every
command that is executed. This is not the same as `> /dev/null` because we're talking about
the commands not their output.
"Then why is there an @ symbol?" you might ask.
Because @ temporarily turns off the command output.
To be able to silence the command that silences the rest of the commands you need to use the
inline 'silencer' symbol. And ladies and gentlemen this is the moment
I gave up on not being sarcastic about explaining this script. Even the first row is such a joke. Anyway.

You know Unix shell scripts use commands to imitate conditions, loops, etc. Batch goes as far
so you can issue a command to create a comment. It's called `REM` and it literally
has no meaning, it's just a placeholder command for comments. Of course, you can use
`::` which is an actual comment feature in Batch, but for some reason I did not use it.

<InfoBox>
  You know what? Let's peek into the implementation of Batch and see how they implemented `REM`. 
  So apparently the command is assigned to the NullHandler.
  Here's the implementation of the NullHandler:
```c
/*
 *  Do nothing. Return TRUE so the the command will not
 *  be considered as bad.
 */
int NullHandler (char *lpParam)
{
    return(TRUE);
}
```
  Understandable, have a nice day.

The next command is `SETLOCAL EnableDelayedExpansion`. Oh boy. Why did I even start this report?
Okay. So [`SETLOCAL`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/setlocal)
is _supposed to_ create a scope for environment variables, meaning you can
manipulate them until the execution reaches the `ENDLOCAL` command.
Instead of stopping right there in functionality, there are two extra parameters that changes the behavior
of the script, one of them is `EnableDelayedExpansion`.
