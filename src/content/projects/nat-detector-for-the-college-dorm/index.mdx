I was a second year student at [BME](https://vik.bme.hu/en/) when my friend invited me over to
one of the most popular subgroup in the [faculty](https://kszk.bme.hu/). They offered a lot professionally
in exchange for maintaining the network of the whole dorm.
These people learned by themselves from placing APs, measuring signal strength, configuring
the network on every floor, tangle themselves in patch cables, creating and hosting services
for the students and from time to time, (but most importantly, lending pots to students to cook).

Every student had to register their devices on the network, otherwise they couldn't even connect.
So if you had a phone, a tablet and a laptop, that's three devices that needs to be registered and tracked by
the dorm network.

# The problem

Some of these students were tired of this whole ordeal so they registered their own WiFi enabled router
on the network and connected whatever device they wanted on that network.
Somehow this wasn't desired by us, maintainers although I don't remember why.

# The solution

<Image src={architecture} alt='Network architecture of the detector' />

We wanted to detect such behaviors by tapping on the dorm egress line.
This was meant to be done by port mirroring the main switch.
(In theory) we would have connected the mirrored data to the second ethernet port of the server
while the primary one can be used for communication.

The only issue was that we never really finished it. I put a reasonable amount of code into it
but somehow it never reached a decent state where we could try it out.
All I can do now is presenting the half-done logic.

# The Half-done Logic

The project was written in C++ that pretty much made it 2 times harder to write
than Python, for example. For us, I mean. But let's start at the beginning.

At top level the program consist of two parts; initialization and running.
Let's start with the initialization part.

```cpp
void init_signals(){
    struct sigaction sa;
    memset(&sa, 0, sizeof(sa));
    sa.sa_handler = exit_netsec;
    sigaction(SIGINT, &sa, NULL);
}
```

The program starts with initializing signals, specifically SIGINT.
This is an important step because we need to shut down packet consuming gracefully
if we later exit the application.

<InfoBox>
  The SIGINT signal is sent to a process by its controlling terminal when a user wishes to interrupt the process.
  ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(IPC)))
</InfoBox>

Then we initialize the consumers and the producer with respect to the CPU core count.

```cpp
int consumers_num = std::max<int>(CORE_NUM - 1, 1);
consumers.reserve(consumers_num);
for (int i = 0; i < consumers_num; i++) {
    consumers.emplace_back(
        &stats_data, PacketConsumer::PluginPack{...}
    );
}
producer = PacketProducer::debugInstance(interface, "src host 192.168.0.100");
```

After this stage, we call `run()` and all the threads we just created are started.
From now on, _Producer_ feeds the mirrored packets into a ~~[ring buffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer)
while the _Consumers_ are trying to consume as many entries as possible.
The bigger the buffer, the less chance for the consumer to stuck in waiting state.~~
It's round robin with a queue in front of every consumer,
but originally I wanted to do it with a ring buffer.

Let's see how the producer works:

```cpp
#include <pcap.h>
...
class PacketProducer {
    ...
    void get(RawPacketElem *temp_packet){
        struct pcap_pkthdr hdr;
        const uint8_t *data;
        while ((data = pcap_next(pcap_handle, &hdr)) == NULL);
        if (hdr.caplen < hdr_len){
            throw std::system_error{};
        }
        else {
            data += hdr_len;
            hdr.caplen -= hdr_len;
        }
        *temp_packet = RawPacketElem{data, hdr.caplen};
    }
    void run(std::vector<PacketConsumer> *consumers){
        RawPacketElem data;
        get(&data);
        while (RUN_PRODUCER){
            for (auto &consumer : *consumers){
                if (consumer.try_put(&data)){
                    get(&data);
                }
            }
        }
        RUN_CONSUMER.store(false);
        for (auto &consumer : *consumers){
            // wake consumers
            consumer.put(&data);
        }
    }
    ...
}
```

The `run()` method gets some data into the `RawPacketElem` variable and
starts an infinite loop to round-robin between the consumers.
If a consumer is not available and `try_put` returns false,
it keeps going and feeds the rest of the consumers.
`get()` simply reads from the port with `pcap_next()`.

The consumer has a locking queue in front of it so that when there are no
items to dequeue, the consumer is in a waiting state.
Same goes for the producer. If the queue is full, producer is in a waiting state.
This behavior is solved by [semaphores](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaphore_(programming)#Semaphores_vs._mutexes>).

Plugins are - as the name implies - plugins. You can hook on udp, tcp, ipv4 or ipv6.
They are expected to report informations given to them.
Consumers have them available and call all plugins for every packet they captured.
That's why the producer will be paused most of the time as the plugins
are too slow compared to the very few lines of Producer.

This project looks almost finished but somehow it didn't reach that stage
where I could have told the other students that it's ready.
I honestly regret it because I searched the internet and
it turns out they started over in 2019 (4 years later) and reached their goals after a good 6 months.
I reached out to the current team leader via e-mail so that I can close this project introduction
with grace.

_coming soon_
