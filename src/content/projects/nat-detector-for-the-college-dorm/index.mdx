I was a second year student at [BME](https://vik.bme.hu/en/) when my friend invited me over to
one of the most popular faculty, called [KSZK](https://kszk.bme.hu/). They offered a lot professionally
in exchange for maintaining the network of the whole dorm.
These people learned by themselves from placing APs, measuring signal strength, configuring
the network on every floor, tangle themselves in patch cables, creating and hosting services for the students.
