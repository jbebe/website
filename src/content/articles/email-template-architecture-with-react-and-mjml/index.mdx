_This guide targets experienced frontend developers who want guidance
on how to create a good email template project.
I am not sharing the final code, only the important steps.
Some of our decisions are company-specific,
so the takeaway is the process as a whole._

# State of html emails

- mjml and other solutions to creating email templates
- weird ms outlook behavior, specific behavior for different clients

# Why MJML?

- Describe what mjml does and how that’s beneficial for us

---

# MJML + React

- How @faire/react-mjml helps with development

---

# Choose your bundler

- Webpack or vite
- I’ll just mention webpack and don’t go into too much detail. Explain vite in detail, why we chose it over webpack.
