# Negative perks

**Nightmares** - Due to nightmares I wake up sweating, having low stats in the morning. I think this is totally plausible and lore friendly debuff. Especially now that Henry lost his family and friends.

**Claustrophobia** - My head stuck in a tree when I was young so I don't feel so good in tight spaces. Plausible, I'm not claustrophobic per se but the debuff is actually pretty good: my stats are lowered in a helmet. I hate wearing a helmet in game so this won't be too annoying.

**Haemophilia** - A genetic disease make me bleed more than I should. I never ever used a bandage so at least now it will come in handy. I hope it won't be too bad.

**Brittle Bones** - My bones are weak so fall damage is worse than on normal.

*All the other perks are just pointless self-punishment so I left it out of my hardcore experience.*

# Beginnings

My day in Skalitz was cut short by the attack of the Cumans. The castle gates were all closed so I fled through a secret door to Talmberg. While trying to steal a horse I managed to save Theresa from those beasts, but then I had a lot more trouble with my chasers. In Talmberg I met this beautiful woman, Lady Stephanie who seemed way more interested in my story than anyone else. I needed to bury my parents so after a short healing period I went back to Skalitz. Bodies were all over, it was a bloodbath everywhere. Unfortunately I met some looters. Disgusting people. With the help of Sir Radzig's one handed sword I deterred two looters from their act. Maybe it was the blade but I managed without a scratch. There was a third one on the outskirts of Skalitz but he looked too determined and I didn't want to get involved in a fight to the death. Long story short, I failed to bury my parents, a mercenary hit me on the head and I almost bleed out if Sir Robard didn't save me. 

# Day 1

I mustered up enough energy to wake up. Turns out Theresa moved to the local miller in Rattay, Peshek. She treated me well, I should remember to make up for her services. She also told me to talk with Peshek. Peshek mentioned the price of my treatment. He offered me a cheap way out that involved digging up graves. I declined as Jesus watches my every move. He got angry but I sworn I will pay back as soon as possible. I already had 39 groschen so I just needed a little more. I chose herb picking as a quick source of money so I sold some kilos of nettle to the poacher's wife and ran back to Peshek with the required 50 groschen. Now that I got rid of the sinful miller, I set aside Theresa and went for Sir Radzig. I explained him how the sword went missing and that I offer my services to him even if it is of little help now. Cpt. Bernard gave me a basic training in one handed sword figthing. I think I'm pretty good at this. Turns out I really am. Hans Capon, heir of Rattay told me to duel him both in archery and sword fighting and I won! You should have seen his face. It was getting really dark then so I had to seek shelter. Although I enjoy sleeping on the ground, I needed a place to sort my stuff out. I headed the inn east of the castle and tried to bargain for an unspecified amount of time with my little money. The innkeeper said no, so I had a genious idea. If I double my money in dice I have enough to stay! So I did the deed. 100 groschen, doubled. Poor guy was furious. The innkeeper on the other hand welcomed me warmly as I put the 200 groschen in his hands. 

# Day 2

Today started with meeting the bailiff. I told him that I'm ready to serve with what I have so he assigned me as a guard for one day. Nightingale the head watchman guided me through the town. We saw beggars, misbehaving guards and Hans Capon being a jerk again. Long story short he asked me to join him on a hunt. The day went by fast so all I had time for is crawling back to my bed. I'm really looking forward to the hunt but I need to prepare for parting with these people. I need to follow my own heart and not be ordered around forever.

## TODO: 

* Find out about the Bakery girl that Nightingale mentioned
* Court Theresa, ask around about mutt
